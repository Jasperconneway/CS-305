Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans for its customers such as savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company requirements were to add a file verification step to 
its web application to ensure secure communications. They required this security to be up to date and effective. The verification step was made in the form of a checksum.

For the project I worked for a software engineering company called Global Rain. I believe I upheld the company's mission - "Security is everyone's responsibility" - and ensured Artemis Financial was secure and up 
to date. I added a SHA-256 cryptographic hash function for checksum verification. I also updated the system and ran a dependency check report until there were no vulnerabilities. This is all important because it 
decreases the likelihood of an attack. It also decreases how much damage an attacker can do to the system and customers. This saves money, customer trust, and reputation. It also promotes customers to come to your 
company in the first place. 

I think the most challenging part was determining what all needed updated and if I had done enough to secure the company's code. In order to increase layers of security I ensured there was input validation and 
there were proper testing protocols. I ensured all names throughout the code were correct and versions were up to date. In the future, I will continue to run dependency check reports and update to the latest 
versions that are secure.

Additionally, the before and after dependency reports informed me if the software application was functional and secure. They also determined if I introduced additional vulnerabilities or not. I was able to 
continue running new checks as necessary.

From this assignment, future employers may find the checksum verification interesting to see and the work I completed with the reports to ensure the application was secure.
